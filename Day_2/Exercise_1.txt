1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
- Sometimes we use setImmediate to provide data/result for the next event after I/O events completed, while using setTimeout we don't know when the I/O event are completed.

2. Explain the difference between process.netTick and setImmediate?
- The process.nextTick called to put the events into nextTick queue and then call to execute all of them.
- The setImmediate called to execute events in check queue after the I/O events completed.
